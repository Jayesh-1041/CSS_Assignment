    <h2>Q :- 4)</h2>    Name a few CSS style components. 
    <h3>Ans: </h3>      "At its most basic level, CSS consists of two components"
                        1.Properties: These are human-readable identifiers that indicate which stylistic 
                          features you   want to modify. For example, font-size , width , background-color.
                        2.Values: Each property is assigned a value. This value indicates how to style the property.
               

    <h2>Q :- 5)</h2>    What do you understand by CSS opacity?            
    <h3>Ans: </h3>      In addition to RGB, you can use an RGB color value with an alpha channel 
                        (RGBA)-which specifies the opacity for a color. An RGBA color value is 
                        specified with:rgba (red, green, blue, alpha). The alpha parameter is a number between 0.0 (fully transparent) and 1.0 (fully opaque).


    <h2>Q :- 6)</h2>    How can the background color of an element be changed?            
    <h3>Ans: </h3>      We can set background color by selecting the element by its class name of 
                        id name and then apply the background-color property on it to set the background color. 
                        Syntax: background-color: color_name; 
    
    
    <h2>Q :- 7)</h2>    How can image repetition of the backup be controlled?
    <h3>Ans: </h3>      The background-repeat property in CSS is used to repeat the background 
                        image both horizontally and vertically. It also decides whether the background 
                        image will be repeated or not.
                        "Syntax" 
                        (background-repeat: repeat|repeat-x|repeat-y|no-repeat|initial|inherit;)


    <h2>Q :- 8)</h2>    What is the use of the background-position property?
    <h3>Ans: </h3>      The background-position property sets the starting position of a background 
                        image. Tip: By default, a background-image is placed at the top-left corner of an 
                        element, and repeated both vertically and horizontally.



    <h2>Q :- 9)</h2>    Which property controls the image scroll in the background?
    <h3>Ans: </h3>      We can specify a different value of the background-attachment property for each 
                        background image, separated by commas. The default value of image scrolling is scroll. 
                        Attribute Values: scroll: It prevents the element from scrolling with the contents, 
                        but scrolls with the page


    <h2>Q :- 10)</h2>   Why should background and color be used as separate properties?            
    <h3>Ans: </h3>      The background property is a complex property in CSS, and if it is combined with color, 
                        the complexity will further increase. Color is an inherited property while the background.
    
          


    <h2>Q :- 11)</h2>   How to center block elements using CSS1?            
    <h3>Ans: </h3>      Block elements can be aligned by setting the left and right margins to "align‚Äù with the 
                        "margin: auto;" and "text-align:center;" property we can align the block level elements 
                        into the centre.block-level element occupies the entire space of its parent element.


    <h2>Q :- 12)</h2>   How to maintain the CSS specifications?            
    <h3>Ans: </h3>      The CSS specifications are maintained by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). 
                        Even though every browser supports CSS, there are many inconsistencies in the supported specification version.


    <h2>Q :- 13)</h2>   What are the ways to integrate CSS as a web page?            
    <h3>Ans: </h3>      CSS may be added to HTML in three different ways. To style a single HTML element on the page, 
                        use Inline CSS in a style attribute. By adding CSS to the head section of our HTML document, 
                        we can embed an internal stylesheet. We can also connect to an external stylesheet that separates our CSS from our HTML.


    <h2>Q :- 14)</h2>   What is embedded style sheets?            
    <h3>Ans: </h3>      An embedded style sheet is declared within the < head > element of an XHTML document. 
                        It applies to the whole document, rather than just one element. Each style declaration gets applied to everything in the document that matches that rule.
    
    
    <h2>Q :- 15)</h2>   What are the external style sheets?     
    <h3>Ans: </h3>      An external style sheet is a separate CSS file that can be accessed by creating a 
                        link within the head section of the webpage. Multiple webpages can use the same 
                        link to access the stylesheet. The link to an external style sheet is placed within the head section of the page. 


    <h2>Q :- 16)</h2>   What are the advantages and disadvantages of using external style sheets?            
    <h3>Ans: </h3>      CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. Some of its primary advantages are 
                        increased website speed, time efficiency, flexibility, consistency, etc. Its disadvantages are limited security, cross-browser issues, extra work for developers, etc. 


    <h2>Q :- 17)</h2>   What is the meaning of the CSS selector?     
    <h3>Ans: </h3>      A CSS selector is the first part of a CSS Rule. It is a pattern of elements and 
                        other terms that tell the browser which HTML elements should be selected to have the CSS property values inside the rule applied to them. 


    <h2>Q :- 18)</h2>   What are the media types allowed by CSS?            
    <h3>Ans: </h3>      CSS defines the following media groups: continuous or paged. visual, 
                        audio, speech, or tactile. grid (for character grid devices), or bitmap. 


    <h2>Q :- 19)</h2>   What is the rule set?     
    <h3>Ans: </h3>      A CSS rule set contains one or more selectors and one or more declarations. 
                        The selector(s), which in this example is h1 , points to an HTML element. The declaration(s), 
                        which in this example are color: blue and text-align: center style the element with a property and value.
